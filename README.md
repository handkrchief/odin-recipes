# Recipes

This is a simple project developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. It serves as an exercise to practice basic HTML skills, including creating structured content using headers, paragraphs, lists, images, and links. The project consists of a homepage (index) that links to individual recipe pages.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a static website displaying a collection of recipes. Each recipe page features essential elements such as:

- **Headers**: For titles and subheadings.
- **Paragraphs**: To describe the recipes and provide instructions.
- **Lists**: To enumerate ingredients and steps.
- **Images**: To display pictures of the recipes.
- **Links**: To navigate between the homepage and recipe pages.

## Features

- **Homepage (index.html)**: Contains links to individual recipe pages.
- **Recipe Pages**: Each page includes a title, an image of the dish, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions.
- **Basic Navigation**: Links make it easy to move between the homepage and different recipes.
